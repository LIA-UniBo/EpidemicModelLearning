# Epidemic Model Learning

What are the correct decisions to take when fighting a pandemic?

## Requirements

The `covasim` simulator is compatible only with `python` version **>=3.6** and **<3.9**
and you must have `llvm10` installed on your system.
All the other dependencies can be satisfied running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We suggest the use of `virtualenv` in order not to install the required libraries globally in your system.
